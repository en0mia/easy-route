<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

easy-route is a Python üêç package üì¶ that will allow you to define the routes for your Flask projects in a simple yet
effective way.

A Route object is composed by a few configurable and extensible components:
- Middlewares
- Controller

### Middlewares

The middleware is the first component in the Route stack.

It takes care of operations like data validation, authentication check, ...

Each route can contain zero, one or more middlewares that will be executed before the controller one by one, in
insertion order.

A middleware can stop the Route execution by returning a Response object, for instance it may return a `HTTP 400`
response if the input data is invalid, or a `HTTP 401` if the user is not authenticated.

If the middleware succeeds, it returns `None` to tell the Route to go ahead with other components.

### Controllers

The controller is the core of every route, as it implements the logic behind the route.

After all the middlewares have been validated, the Route calls the controller and returns its result.

A Route, by definition, can contain only a single Controller.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
The usage of this package is pretty straightforward.

Firstly, you have to create a Route object:

```python
route = Route(request, MyController())
```

Then you can add one or more middleware(s):

```python
route.add_middleware(MyMiddleware())

# Or, to add more than one middleware at once:
route.add_middlewares([MyMiddleware(), SecondMiddleware()])
```

After the middlewares you can run the route and return its response:

```python
return route.dispatch()
```
